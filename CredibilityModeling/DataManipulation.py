    This file contains functions for data manipulation and preprocessing that will be 
    used in the credibility modeling process by all 3 credibility models. This includes
    functions for loading the data, preprocessing the data, and splitting the data into
    training/dev/test as well as saving the split so that the split used by all models
    will be consistent. It used DataObject.py to store and transfer data.
