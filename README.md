# PittCoin
A group project for Pitt CS2731, intro to natural language processing. The purpose of this research project was to see if we could predict the credibility of financial news articles, and if so, use the credibility of a news article to better predict S&P 500 movement the day following the article's publishing than when just using the article itself. Our results can be found in PittCoin_Final_Report.pdf

Steps for initiating new development - 
1. Begin by creating a new branch, either from the 'dev' branch or the desired base branch. It is advisable to choose 'dev' as the base branch for the most up-to-date codebase.

2. Push the changes you make to this new branch.

3. Generate a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the 'dev' branch. Ensure that at least one developer reviews and approves your changes.

Congratulations! Your code is now successfully integrated into the repository.
