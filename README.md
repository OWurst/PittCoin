Steps for initiating new development - 
1. Begin by creating a new branch, either from the 'dev' branch or the desired base branch. It is advisable to choose 'dev' as the base branch for the most up-to-date codebase.

2. Push the changes you make to this new branch.

3. Generate a Pull Request (PR) from your branch to the 'dev' branch. Ensure that at least one developer reviews and approves your changes.

Congratulations! Your code is now successfully integrated into the repository.
